# Intro

Kuaidula app actually include two parts, one is app parts, another is NLP

# Contribution

Right now the repository is private, and I do not think it will go public in the future, but in order to make use of Github collaboration functionality, some rules have to be made. Everybody wanna makes contribution to this repository needs to:

## Modify only on branches other than "master"

As you know, the default working branch is "master" branch, however, it is very hard to maintain consistency among multi users. So, if you want add or modify anything, make sure you do all things on branched other than "master" (create new branch if there is no other branches)

After modification or several commits, if you think it is about time to put into "master" branch, create a "pull request" to merge. 

## Do include some comments
Whatever in codes or commit message, include some brief comments, 
In case you do not understand what you are doing 

## Do not upload sensitive infomation

Do not upload password or other... sensitive infomation

## Make use of .gitignore

Some files (built files, binary files, compiled files) should not be put on Github, make use of .gitignore to exclude these.
